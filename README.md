## Enhancing Flight Recommendation: Using Cold-Start Strategies

## Introduction
The Flight Ticket Recommendation System is an Interdisciplinary Project (IDP/Mini Project) undertaken by students of the 3rd Year Computer Science Engineering (CSE) department at Vignan University. Under the guidance of Ms. Pushya Chaparala, Assistant Professor in the Department of CSE, the project aims to revolutionize flight booking experiences by leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques.

The project focuses on enhancing the user experience through personalized flight ticket suggestions derived from historical travel data and user preferences. The system optimizes flight booking decisions by integrating advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms, providing users with tailored recommendations that align with their specific travel needs and past booking behaviors.

## Components of the Recommendation System

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
- **Purpose**: Load historical flight booking data and preprocess it for analysis.
- **Steps**:
  - Import data from sources such as CSV files or databases.
  - Clean and preprocess data to handle missing values, format inconsistencies, and outliers.
  - Extract relevant features including airline, class, price, source, destination, and passenger ID.

### 2. Model Construction
- **Purpose**: Construct a user model based on historical booking patterns to capture preferences.
- **Components**:
  - **User Model (D)**: Stores frequencies of feature values (e.g., airline, class) for each passenger.
  - **Weights (W)**: Calculate weights for features based on their uniqueness and frequency of occurrence.

### 3. Recommendation Algorithm
- **Purpose**: Recommend flight tickets that best match a passenger's preferences.
- **Methodology**:
  - Evaluate candidate tickets based on similarity to historical bookings using the constructed user model (D) and feature weights (W).
  - Calculate a recommendation score (Gt) for each ticket considering features like airline, class, and price.
  - Rank tickets by their recommendation scores and present the top recommendations to the passenger.

### 4. Data Visualization and Analysis
- **Purpose**: Provide insights into flight routes, ticket prices, and passenger preferences.
- **Techniques**:
  - Visualize the distribution of flight routes and their popularity using histograms and bar charts.
  - Analyze price trends and variations across different routes to identify cost-effective options.
  - Present findings through descriptive statistics and graphical representations to facilitate decision-making.

## Key Concepts and Formulas

### 1. Weight Calculation Formula
- **Purpose**: Determine the significance of each feature (e.g., airline, class) in influencing ticket recommendations.
- **Formula**: 
  ```
  W[f] = log(len(D[f])) - sum(D[f].values()) / len(D[f])
  ```
  - Where:
    - **W[f]**: Weight for feature **f**.
    - **D[f]**: Dictionary storing frequencies of feature values.

### 2. Recommendation Score Calculation
- **Purpose**: Compute a score to rank candidate tickets based on user preferences and historical data.
- **Formula**:
  ```
  Gt = sum(D[f][tf] / sum(D[f].values()) * W[f])
  ```
  - Where:
    - **Gt**: Recommendation score for ticket **t**.
    - **D[f][tf]**: Frequency of feature value **tf** for feature **f** in historical data.

## Usage
- **Inputs**:
  - Passenger ID: Unique identifier for the passenger.
  - Source and Destination: Travel route for which recommendations are sought.
- **Outputs**:
  - Top recommended flight tickets based on the provided inputs, including airline, class, flight details, and prices.

## Conclusion
The Flight Ticket Recommendation System represents a sophisticated application of data-driven insights to streamline flight booking processes. By integrating advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms, the system ensures that users receive optimized recommendations tailored to their travel preferences and historical booking patterns.
